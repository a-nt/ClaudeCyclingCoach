# Fitness Trends Report: [Date Range]

## Current Fitness Status

- **CTL (Chronic Training Load):** [XXX] - Your fitness level
- **ATL (Acute Training Load):** [XXX] - Your fatigue level
- **TSB (Training Stress Balance):** [+/-XX] - Your form

### What These Numbers Mean

**CTL (Fitness):** Rolling 42-day average of training stress. Higher = more fitness.

**ATL (Fatigue):** Rolling 7-day average of training stress. Higher = more accumulated fatigue.

**TSB (Form):** CTL - ATL. Your readiness to perform.
- **Positive TSB:** Fresh, good for racing/testing
- **Negative TSB:** Fatigued, building fitness
- **Near zero:** Balanced training load

## 30-Day Trend Analysis

### CTL Progression

[Graph or data visualization description]

**Starting CTL:** [XXX] ([date])
**Current CTL:** [XXX] ([date])
**Change:** [+/-XX] points ([+/-XX]%)

### Interpretation

[Analysis of CTL trend:
- Steady increase: Building fitness progressively
- Rapid increase: Risk of overtraining
- Decline: Taper or unplanned rest
- Plateau: Maintenance phase]

### ATL Pattern

**Average ATL:** [XXX]
**Peak ATL:** [XXX] on [date]
**Current ATL:** [XXX]

### Interpretation

[Analysis of fatigue patterns:
- Consistently high: Heavy training block
- Spiky pattern: Inconsistent training
- Declining: Recovery phase or reduced volume]

### TSB Trajectory

**TSB Range:** [low] to [high]
**Current TSB:** [+/-XX]
**Days in negative TSB:** [XX] of last 30 days

### Interpretation

[Analysis of form trajectory:
- Mostly negative: Building fitness, accepting fatigue
- Moving positive: Freshening up, recovery or taper
- Highly negative: Potential overreaching]

### Load Pattern Analysis

[Analysis of weekly load distribution:
- Progressive overload pattern
- Recovery weeks included
- Load variability
- Training consistency]

## Wellness Correlations

[If wellness data available:]

### Sleep Quality vs Performance

[Analysis of sleep quality correlation with TSS]

### Resting Heart Rate Trends

**Average RHR:** [XX] bpm
**Trend:** [Rising/Falling/Stable]

**Interpretation:** [Analysis of RHR trends as fatigue indicator]

### HRV (Heart Rate Variability)

[If available - HRV trends and correlation with training load]

## Coaching Assessment

### Current Training Phase

[Identification of current phase: Base building, Build, Peak, Recovery, etc.]

### Load Management

**Rating:** [Excellent/Good/Needs Attention]

[Assessment of whether training load is:
- Appropriate for goals
- Sustainable
- Properly periodized
- Including adequate recovery]

### Fitness Direction

[Assessment of fitness trajectory:
- On track for goals
- Peaking at right time
- Building too quickly/slowly
- Need for adjustment]

## Recommendations

### Immediate (Next 7 Days)

1. **[Recommendation type]:** [Specific guidance for next week]
2. **[Recommendation type]:** [Specific guidance for next week]

### Medium-term (Next 2-4 Weeks)

1. **[Recommendation type]:** [Strategic guidance for coming weeks]
2. **[Recommendation type]:** [Strategic guidance for coming weeks]

### Key Focus Areas

- **[Focus area 1]:** [Why this matters now]
- **[Focus area 2]:** [Why this matters now]
- **[Focus area 3]:** [Why this matters now]

## Red Flags to Monitor

[Any concerning patterns:]
- [ ] Rapid CTL increase (>8 points/week)
- [ ] Extended negative TSB (<-30 for >2 weeks)
- [ ] Declining performance despite high load
- [ ] Elevated resting heart rate
- [ ] Poor sleep quality persisting

## Questions to Consider

- [Question about training goals and timeline]
- [Question about upcoming events or priorities]
- [Question about how you're feeling vs what data shows]
- [Question about adjustments needed]
