# Coaching Notes

> Personal coaching notes that evolve over time. The coach reads this at the start
> of every session and writes to it as it learns about your preferences, patterns,
> and goals.

## Training Preferences

*(Coach will note your preferences here as it learns them)*

Example:
- Prefers not to do FTP tests - finds them stressful
- Enjoys long endurance rides on weekends
- Limited time on weekdays - sessions should be <1 hour

## Physical Considerations

*(Any injuries, equipment limitations, or physical constraints)*

Example:
- Bad left knee - avoid explosive sprint efforts
- No power meter on outdoor bike - use RPE/HR for outdoor rides

## Communication Style

*(How you prefer to receive coaching advice)*

Example:
- Direct, concise responses (2-4 sentences)
- Lead with insight not data dumps
- Likes actionable next-steps

## Goals & Timeline

*(Current goals, target events, training focus)*

Example:
- Gran Fondo June 15, 2026 (A-race)
- Building endurance base, target CTL ~65 by race day
- Secondary goal: improve 20-min power to 280W+

## Training Patterns Observed

*(Coach's observations about what works well for you)*

Example:
- Responds well to Polarized 80/20 approach
- Tends to drift into Z3 when not mindful
- Most consistent on weekend rides
- CTL ramps best at 5-6 TSS/week

## Recent Observations

*(Time-stamped notes about recent training)*

Example:
- 2026-02-05: Back to training after 3 weeks off, CTL dropped 52→43
- 2026-02-05: Spending 35% time in Z3 - working on polarization
