## Zone Distribution

### Power Zones (% of time)

Based on FTP of [XXX]W:

- **Z1 (<55% FTP):** XX% - Active Recovery
- **Z2 (55-75% FTP):** XX% - Endurance
- **Z3 (75-90% FTP):** XX% - Tempo
- **Z4 (90-105% FTP):** XX% - Threshold
- **Z5 (>105% FTP):** XX% - VO2 Max

### Interpretation

[Analysis of zone distribution - was this an endurance ride, interval session, race effort?]

## Aerobic Decoupling Analysis

**First Half:**
- Average Power: [XXX]W
- Average HR: [XXX] bpm
- Efficiency: [X.XX] W/bpm

**Second Half:**
- Average Power: [XXX]W
- Average HR: [XXX] bpm
